breakdown and real-world application scenarios.\n\n### Supporting Point 2\n* Supporting Elements:\n\t+ Research has shown that power imbalances can have a profound impact on individual outcomes, particularly for marginalized groups (Giddens, 1990).\n\t+ Agency refers to the capacity of individuals and groups to act upon their environments and shape their own futures.\n\t+ By examining power and agency, we can identify opportunities for social change and develop more effective policies and interventions.\n* Examples:\n\t+ The women's suffrage movement in the United States is a prime example of how collective action and grassroots organizing can challenge dominant power structures and achieve significant social change (Gordon, 1970).\n\t+ The concept of \"boycotts\" has been used to counteract corporate power and promote social justice, as seen in the struggles of marginalized communities against exploitative labor practices.\n* Mini-conclusion:\nUnderstanding power and agency is essential for developing effective strategies for social change and promoting greater equality and justice.\n\n**Evidence:** * Supporting Elements:\n\t+ Research has shown that power imbalances can

3\n\n**Topic:** * Supporting Elements:\n\t+ Research has shown that culturally competent practitioners are better equipped to provide high-quality services and achieve positive outcomes for clients (Sue \u0026 Zurcher, 2006).\n\n### Supporting Point 1\n* Supporting Elements:\n\t+ Research has shown that culturally competent practitioners are better equipped to provide high-quality services and achieve positive outcomes for clients (Sue \u0026 Zurcher, 2006).\n\t+ Cultural competence refers to the ability to understand, appreciate, and work with diverse cultural practices and norms.\n\t+ By developing cultural competence, we can build stronger relationships with community members and develop more effective partnerships between practitioners and service providers.\n* Examples:\n\t+ The development of culturally responsive teaching methods has improved educational outcomes for students from diverse backgrounds (Gay, 2000).\n\t+ The concept of \"cultural humility\" emphasizes the importance of acknowledging one's own cultural biases and limitations in order to build trust with clients from diverse backgrounds.\n\n**Evidence:** * Supporting Elements:\n\t+ Research has shown
