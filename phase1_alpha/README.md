# Phase 1 Alpha: Market Intelligence & USP Optimization

## Overview
Phase 1 Alpha is an advanced market intelligence and USP (Unique Selling Proposition) optimization system that analyzes content concepts and optimizes them through recursive AI-powered evaluation.

## Features

### 🎯 **Enhanced USP Optimization Engine**
- Evaluates original concepts against three critical criteria:
  - **Novelty Score** (threshold: >0.60): Conceptual uniqueness
  - **Reader Appeal Score** (threshold: >0.75): Market resonance probability  
  - **Differentiation Score** (threshold: >0.70): Competitive distinction

### 📋 **Enhanced Quantitative Selection Criteria System (NEW)**
- AI-generated rubric with 12 comprehensive criteria including:
  - **Time-to-Market** (weight 0.10): Rapid launch capability assessment
  - **Strategic Fit** (weight 0.12): Brand alignment and pipeline integration
- Weighted scoring system across 5 categories (Market, Content, Author, Strategic, Competition)
- Market intelligence-driven criteria generation
- Comprehensive concept scoring with weighted totals

### 👤 **Intelligent Author Persona Generation (NEW)**
- AI-generated optimal author profiles for each concept
- Market appeal, genre match, and trustability scoring
- Professional biographies and credential recommendations
- Author platform and credibility optimization

### 🤖 **Advanced AI-Powered Concept Generation**
- LLM-integrated concept suggestions with Ollama API
- Intelligent repetition prevention with concept history tracking
- Numbered model selection from available Ollama models
- Criteria-based concept optimization

### 🔄 **Recursive Optimization Loop**
- Maximum 3 iterations with 5 USP variants per iteration
- Automatic threshold checking and early termination
- Intelligent fallback to best variant if thresholds not met

### 📊 **Market Intelligence Gathering**
- Trending topics analysis
- Market gap identification
- Target audience profiling
- Market saturation assessment
- Potential reach estimation

### 🔍 **Competitive Analysis**
- Top 5 competitor identification
- USP comparison and differentiation
- Keyword analysis
- Similarity scoring

### 📈 **Comprehensive Reporting**
- Detailed scoring breakdowns with selection criteria analysis
- Professional selection justification
- Complete variant exploration history
- Market positioning insights
- Author persona recommendations

## Requirements
- Go 1.21+
- Ollama API running on localhost:11434
- Available LLM model

## Usage

### Quick Start
```bash
cd phase1_alpha
go build main.go
./main
```

**Important**: Always rebuild the binary when code changes:
```bash
go build main.go
```

### Input Process
1. **Model Selection**: Choose Ollama model from numbered list
2. **Book Development Strategy**: Choose approach:
   - **Option 1**: Market Intelligence-Driven Flow (RECOMMENDED)
     - Generate initial concept suggestions
     - Gather market intelligence for all concepts  
     - Create criteria based on market data
     - **Score all concepts against all criteria with weighted totals**
     - **Rank concepts and confirm optimal selection**
   - **Option 2**: Generate AI-powered concept suggestions directly  
   - **Option 3**: Enter your own concept manually
3. **Concept Selection**: Choose optimal concept based on market intelligence
4. **Author Persona**: System generates optimal author profile automatically

## Process Flow

### Phase 1: Market Intelligence
- Analyzes trending topics and market gaps
- Identifies target audience characteristics
- Assesses market saturation levels

### Phase 2: Competitive Analysis  
- Identifies top 5 competing titles
- Analyzes competitor USPs and keywords
- Calculates similarity scores

### Phase 3: Initial Evaluation
- Scores original concept against criteria
- Establishes baseline performance

### Phase 4: Recursive Optimization
- Generates 5 variants per iteration (max 3 iterations)
- Evaluates each variant against thresholds
- Early termination on success

### Phase 5: Final Selection
- Selects optimal variant
- Generates professional justification
- Compiles comprehensive results
