They serve as a guiding framework for decision-making, shaping an individual's or organization's approach to challenges and opportunities.\n* **Importance of Core Principles**: Core principles provide a shared understanding among team members, stakeholders, and leaders, ensuring everyone is working towards the same goals and values. This alignment fosters trust, motivation, and accountability, ultimately leading to improved performance and outcomes.\n* **Evidence from Research**: Studies have consistently shown that organizations with clear core concepts and principles tend to outperform those without a well-defined framework (Hart \u0026 Ghoshal, 1990; Kondratovitch et al., 2017). For example, Google's \"20% Time\" policy allows employees to dedicate one day a week to side projects, demonstrating the company's commitment to innovation and creativity.\n\n**Evidence:** * **Definition of Core Concepts**: Core concepts are the fundamental ideas, values, and beliefs that underpin an organization's culture, mission, and vision.
