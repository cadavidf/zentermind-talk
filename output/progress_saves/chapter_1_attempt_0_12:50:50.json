By examining the ways in which people interact with each other and their environment, researchers can identify patterns and processes that shape organizational outcomes (Finkelstein \u0026 Hambrick, 1990). This knowledge is essential for developing effective strategies for improving organizational performance, enhancing employee engagement, and reducing turnover rates.\n\n**Evidence:** The study of organizational behavior provides a critical lens through which to examine the intricate relationships between individuals, groups, and organizations.

(2013) examined the relationship between leader-member exchange (LME) and organizational outcomes. The researchers found that LME was positively related to employee job satisfaction, commitment, and performance. This highlights the critical role that leaders play in shaping organizational behavior and outcomes.\n\n**Evidence:** For example, a study conducted by Kandogan et al.

One of the most influential is the transactional theory of work motivation (Hackman \u0026 Oldham, 1976). According to this framework, motivation is driven by the exchange between individuals and their organization, where workers are motivated by the perceived value they place on their work.\n\n**Evidence:** Several theoretical frameworks provide a foundation for understanding organizational behavior.
