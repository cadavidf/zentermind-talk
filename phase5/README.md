# Phase 5: Title Optimization Loop

## Overview
Optimizes the content title through A/B testing and multiple scoring criteria.

## Input
- `../phase4/media.json` (from Phase 4)

## Output
- `titles.json` - Title variations, A/B test results, and optimized title

## Usage
```bash
cd phase5
go run main.go
```

## Process
1. Load concept title from Phase 4
2. Generate multiple title variations
3. Score each variation on multiple criteria
4. Run simulated A/B tests
5. Select optimized title based on performance

## Scoring Criteria
- **Clickability**: How likely to generate clicks
- **SEO Score**: Search engine optimization potential
- **Memorability**: How easy to remember
- **Clarity**: How clear the value proposition is

## Output Format

## A/B Testing
- Simulates real-world click rates
- Tests multiple variations against each other
- Calculates statistical confidence levels
- Identifies winning titles with high confidence

## Thresholds
- Final Confidence: â‰¥85% for next phase approval
- Minimum improvement for optimization recommendation

## Next Phase
Pass `titles.json` to Phase 6 for content generation with optimized title.
