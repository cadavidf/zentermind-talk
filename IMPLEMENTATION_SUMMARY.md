### Control Mechanisms

**Interactive Commands** (type into console):
```
pause   - Pause after current operation
resume  - Resume paused generation
stop    - Graceful stop with state save
status  - Show detailed progress status
save    - Manual state save
help    - Show available commands
```

**Signal Control** (system-level):
```bash
kill -USR1 <pid>  # Pause
kill -USR2 <pid>  # Resume  
kill -INT <pid>   # Graceful stop
```

**Management Script**:
```bash
./manage_generator.sh start    # Start generation
./manage_generator.sh pause    # Pause via signal
./manage_generator.sh resume   # Resume via signal
./manage_generator.sh stop     # Graceful stop
./manage_generator.sh status   # Check status
./manage_generator.sh monitor  # Real-time monitoring
./manage_generator.sh logs     # View recent logs
./manage_generator.sh clean    # Clean state files
```

## üéØ Key Improvements Over Original

### Timeout Resolution
- **Before**: 2-minute timeout causing failures
- **After**: Indefinite runtime with graceful control

### Visibility
- **Before**: Black box operation with minimal feedback
- **After**: Real-time logging with detailed progress indicators

### Reliability  
- **Before**: No recovery from interruptions
- **After**: Complete resume capability from any point

### Control
- **Before**: All-or-nothing execution
- **After**: Pause/resume/stop at any time

### Resource Management
- **Before**: Potential memory accumulation over long runs
- **After**: Chunked processing with controlled resource usage

## üöÄ Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Build and start
./build_enhanced_generator.sh
./enhanced_sequential_generator
```

### Advanced Management
```bash
# Start with monitoring
./manage_generator.sh start &
./manage_generator.sh monitor

# Pause when needed
./manage_generator.sh pause

# Resume later
./manage_generator.sh resume

# Check status anytime
./manage_generator.sh status
```

### Recovery Scenario
```bash
# If interrupted, simply restart
./enhanced_sequential_generator
# Will prompt: "Previous session found. Resume? (y/n)"
# Type 'y' to continue exactly where you left off
```
