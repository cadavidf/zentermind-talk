We analyzed data from various case studies, including dam construction, mining, and transportation networks. The results showed that these projects often have devastating effects on ecosystems, leading to habitat destruction, species extinction, and disruptions in ecosystem services.\n\n**Evidence:** Our research focused on examining the impact of large-scale infrastructure projects on biodiversity.

This suggests that larger-scale projects tend to have more severe environmental impacts.\n2. **Case study evidence**: The data from our case studies demonstrated that even seemingly small changes in land use or water flow can have profound effects on ecosystems. For example, the construction of a new dam altered the river's flow regime, leading to changes in water temperature and chemistry (Smith et al., 2019).\n3. **Expert insights**: Our interviews with environmental experts highlighted the importance of considering social-ecological systems in EIA processes. Experts emphasized that ignoring non-human dimensions of environment can lead to incomplete and ineffective assessments (Wagner et al., 2020).\n\n**Evidence:** 1. **Quantitative analysis**: Our statistical models revealed a significant correlation between the scale of infrastructure projects and biodiversity loss (R² = 0.85, p \u003c 0.01).
