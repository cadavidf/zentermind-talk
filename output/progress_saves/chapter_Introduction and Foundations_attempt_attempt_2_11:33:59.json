This involves analyzing and interpreting existing knowledge, identifying patterns and relationships between ideas, and developing a nuanced understanding of complex phenomena. For instance, in the field of psychology, the concept of cognitive dissonance was first introduced by Leon Festinger in 1957 (Festinger, 1957). By defining this key concept, researchers were able to better understand human behavior and develop more effective interventions.\n\n**Evidence:** One of the most critical aspects of establishing a strong foundation is defining key concepts and understanding their underlying principles.
